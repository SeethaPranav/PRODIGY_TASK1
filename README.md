# PRODIGY_TASK1
# 📊 Bike Sharing Data Visualization

This project is a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization task using the Bike Sharing Dataset. The primary objective is to create visual representations of both categorical and continuous variables to understand their distribution and patterns.

## 📝 Task Description

The goal of this task was to:
- Create a **bar chart** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical variable** (`season`)
- Create a **histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **continuous variable** (`cnt` - the total count of bike rentals)

## 📈 Visualizations

1. **Bar Chart of Seasons**
   - Mapped season codes (1–4) to human-readable labels (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
   - Used a custom color palette to style the chart
   - Displayed the count of records per season

2. **Histogram of Rental Counts**
   - Plotted the distribution of total bike rental counts (`cnt`)
   - Applied a custom color and included a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for smoother visualization

## 📦 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is based on the **Bike Sharing Dataset**, which includes hourly data on bike rentals along with weather and time-related variables.

## ✅ Output
The generated plots provide insight into:
- The frequency of bike rentals across different seasons
- How the rental count (`cnt`) is distributed over time
